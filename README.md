# Angry Birds clone using Processing
Processing code for an Angry Birds clone using Box2D (2017 project) 

This was a project practice for a Processing class. The original code was given in [this original folder](AngryBirdSimpleOriginal), and I added features and made [this new folder](AngryBirdSimple_SJH). The features include a new map, a logo, and estimated trajectory of the bird.
